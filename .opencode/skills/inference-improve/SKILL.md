# Inference Improvement Skill

## Purpose

Coordinates a collaborative agent workflow to improve routing inference by analyzing logs, reflections, and reports.

## Trigger Phrases

- "improve inference"
- "analyze routing patterns"
- "autonomous improvement"
- "learn from logs"
- "coalesce insights"

## Agent Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Gathering (Researcher)
```
@researcher gather all recent logs, reflections, and reports
- Read logs/framework/activity.log
- Read logs/framework/routing-outcomes.json  
- Read docs/reflections/*.md
- Read logs/reports/session-*.md
- Read logs/reports/job-*.md
```

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis (Code-Analyzer)
```
@code-analyzer analyze gathered data
- Identify routing success/failure patterns
- Detect weak keyword matches
- Find confidence distribution issues
- Locate emerging patterns
```

### Phase 3: Design Improvements (Architect)
```
@architect design routing improvements
- Propose new keyword mappings
- Suggest confidence adjustments
- Recommend complexity thresholds
- Design new routing patterns
```

### Phase 4: Review & Refine (Code-Reviewer)
```
@code-reviewer review proposed changes
- Validate quality of proposals
- Refine suggestions
- Ensure no regressions
- Prioritize changes
```

### Phase 5: Validate & Apply (Enforcer)
```
@enforcer validate and apply changes
- Codex compliance check
- Verify changes are safe
- Apply to routing-mappings.json
- Log improvements
```

## Output

Produces actionable improvements:
1. Updated `routing-mappings.json`
2. New insights report
3. Confidence adjustments
4. Pattern additions/removals

## Configuration

```json
{
  "inference_improvement": {
    "enabled": true,
    "autonomous": true,
    "interval_hours": 24,
    "min_confidence": 0.7
  }
}
```
